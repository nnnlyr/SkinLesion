# SkinLesion

## Project Overview
A deep learning-based system for classifying skin lesions into three categories: Melanoma (MAL), Nevus (NV), and Benign lesions. This project compares traditional machine learning methods (SVM, Random Forest) with deep learning approaches (CNN, ResNet-50) for medical image classification.

## Key Features
- **Multi-class classification of skin lesions using ISIC dataset**

- **Comparison of traditional ML vs deep learning approaches**

- **Advanced data preprocessing with oversampling and augmentation**

- **Comprehensive evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity)**

- **ResNet-50 architecture with transfer learning**
